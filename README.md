Experiments in Python as I learn it

## numberguess
This program comes up with a number in an input interval and has you guess that number. It also gives you a score.

## pyglatintranslator
This program translates a word that you type in to a word in pyglatin. Pyglatin is a language where it takes the first letter from a word, adds it to the end of the word, and then adds "ay" at the end. For example, pyglatin is yglatinpay in pyglatin.

## nremover
This program unsuprisingly removes an 'n' from a message that you type in. As for the joke at the end of the program, that's for you to figure out!

## lettereplacer
Adding on to the nremover program, this program has you type in a message, remove a letter (if you want to), and replaces that letter (if you want to).

## binaryconverter
This program converts a number of your choice from base 10 to binary.

## decimaltoanybase
Adding on to binaryconverter, this program converts a number of your choice from base 10 to any base.

## anybasetodecimal
Adding on to decimaltoanybase, this program converts a number of your choice in a base of your own choice to base 10.

## anybasetoanyotherbase
Adding on to anybasetodecimal, this program converts a number of your choice in a base of your own choice to a base of your choice.
