Experiments in Python as I learn it

## numberguess
This program comes up with a number in an input interval and has you guess that number. It also gives you a score.

## pyglatintranslator
This program translates a word that you type in to a word in pyglatin. Pyglatin is a language where it takes the first letter from a word, adds it to the end of the word, and then adds "ay" at the end. For example, pyglatin is yglatinpay in pyglatin.

## nremover
This program unsuprisingly removes an 'n' from a message that you type in. As for the joke at the end of the program, that's for you to figure out!

## lettereplacer
Adding on to the nremover program, this program has you type in a message, remove a letter (if you want to), and replaces that letter (if you want to).

## binaryconverter
This program converts a number of your choice from base 10 to binary.

## decimaltoanybase
Adding on to binaryconverter, this program converts a number of your choice from base 10 to any base.

## anybasetodecimal
Adding on to decimaltoanybase, this program converts a number of your choice in a base of your own choice to base 10.

## anybasetoanyotherbase
Adding on to anybasetodecimal, this program converts a number of your choice in a base of your own choice to a base of your choice.

## turtles
just playing with some turtles.

## GCFof2
Finding the GCF of 2 integers using the Euclidean Algorithm. Same as java GCFofTwo.

## TicTacToe
Let's play TicTacToe! When you want to place the X's and the O's, type the position in words. The possible positions are:

"top-left", "top-center", "top-right",
"center-left", "center", "center-right", 
"bottom-left", "bottom-center", and "bottom-right".

It is important to note that "center" and "middle" can be used interchangably and you can use a space instead of the hyphen or compound the two words without any separator in between.
